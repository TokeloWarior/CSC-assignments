## Description:
This Java program reads a sequence of memory access addresses from a file, converts them to physical addresses, and writes the results to an output file. The algorithm uses a page table ([2,4,1,7,3,5,6]) to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses based on frame numbers and offsets. with formula...

Physical Address=(Frame NumberÃ—Frame Size)+Offset
